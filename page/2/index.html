            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I have always wanted a personal website since I was in university, a place on the internet where I can share anything I want. (I am not a big fan of social media)</p>
<p>As a result, I have made a few attempts in the past by using web technologies such as the LAMP and MERN stack which I had learned in university and online courses.</p>
<p>Though it worked, I spent too much time on the design and the code, and not enough time on the content. By the time I had finished the website, other things had taken priority, and I had no time to write anything.</p>
<p>Now that university is over, I have decided to give it another go. This time, I have decided to use Zola, a static site generator written in Rust.</p>
<h2 id="why-zola">Why Zola?</h2>
<p>I have chosen Zola because I am a big fan of Rust having just learned it recently.</p>
<p>It is statically generated, I can use a simple hosting service such as GitHub Pages to host my website.</p>
<p>Zola uses Markdown, which is a simple markup language that I am familiar with having used it in the past for note taking and writing documentation. As I am a software engineer, I would want to give some code examples in my posts, and Markdown makes it easy to do so with syntax highlighting.</p>
<pre data-lang="rs" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rs "><code class="language-rs" data-lang="rs"><span style="color:#b48ead;">fn </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">main</span><span>() {
</span><span>    println!(&quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">Hello, Zola!</span><span>&quot;);
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can also use a theme, which will save me a lot of time on the design, which I am not very good at.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-expect-from-this-website">What can you expect from this website?</h2>
<p>I will be using this website to share my journey in software engineering.</p>
<p>This includes my experience in learning new technologies, my thoughts on software engineering, and my projects.</p>
<p>I am by no means an expert in software engineering, but I hope that by sharing my experiences, I am able to consolidate what I have learned and help others who are also learning software engineering.</p>
