# About me

Hey! I'm Andrew, a software engineer in Australia working in real-time simulations for mining technologies.

## My interests

- **Software Engineering** - I love learning new technologies and building things with them.
- **Video Games** - I have been playing video games since I was a kid, and I still play them to this day.
- **Cooking** - I love cooking, I cook almost every day, mostly pasta and Asian food.

## My skills

- **Programming Languages** - C++, Rust, C#, Lua, Python, TypeScript
- **Technologies** - Unity, OpenGL, wgpu, .NET, React, Express.js, Git
- **Knowledge** - Game Engine Development, Games Development, Graphics Programming, Web Development, Object-Oriented Programming, Data-Oriented Design

## What I'm currently learning

- **Rust** - I am primarily a C++ developer, and after hearing many good things about Rust, I decided to give it a try.
- **Vim Motions** - I was astonished by how fast some people can navigate in Vim, and I want to be able to do the same.
